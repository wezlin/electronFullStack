# take-home-assignment-electron

This is a take home assignment in electron.js for a prospective candidate.

## Assignment

Create a simple server using express.js. The server should have a GET request endpoint that sends the result from main.exe python executable found in the "src/python" folder to the file named "HomePage" found in the "src" folder.

MANDATORY: You should be able to run the app with both "npm start" and the executable (distributable) named "my-app" which is built using "npm run make" on a machine that does not have python installed.

DO NOT make a separate command to run the server alone.

I have attached two png files called "finalResultGreet.png" and "finalResultSquare.png" that shows the expected result of the app depending on whether you choose "greet" or "square".

Feel free to install any dependencies and refactor any code you need to complete the assignment.

Once you have completed the assignment, please send us a link to your forked repository that is on your personal GitHub account.
